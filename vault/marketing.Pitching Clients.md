Always say

"i want to work WITH you"
not
"I want to work for you"



Start by 
CREATING A FOMO
BUILD A STORY
FACT CHECK
MAKE IT RELATABLE

ACT AS A CONSUMER NOT A SALES GUY

RESEARCH ON RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS


COMPEL HIM TO REPLY

THEN ONE IT WARMS UP, PITCH

DONT FOLLOW UP, START A CONVERSATION. BE A VALUE ADDER

Leave the ball in his court

Never ask close ended questions

Prepare for the failure

Subjevt line should have your name
