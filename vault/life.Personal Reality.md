- uninhibited self expression

Personal reality : no one will have access to this.

All of our life is mainly personal reality. All conversations go in your head.

This is what you live in.

Mental Health = Personal Reality 

If you are not bothered about X, and you are being told about X, you don't give a shit about it. You dont carry this idea. Suppose this X is mental health

Eg. If no one is depressed around you, and you are being made aware if depression, than you wont carry that idea. That is problem of awareness xD.


What it Means to Build your personal relality / Mentally healthy?

1. Should vs Want

Id : pleasure (Want)
Superego : everybody/society elses voice (Should)
Ego : negitiator/conversation bw two

Want -> dreams / ambition / belief based passion / irrational / pleasure / gives you strength

Superego -> controls your strength / keeps you in check / consistency / discipline / courage / if you follow entirely you would end up like everyone else / if your all operations in should level you are not you.

Ego -> our control lies here

Live in Civilized Society -> tradeoff individuality

Should and want is to be balanced. Hence personal reality emerges.

Want -> Happy
Should  -> Relieved

Learn Frame have to do in a way you want to do.

What story you tell yourself becones your reality.

Shiuld and want shuld be friends.

Want needs to be understood and cultivated in direction of should.

Should small scale, want long term game.

You are not one thing, you are many things in your head.

Both have to be looked at and experimented with. That is contruction of unslaved free person.

Accept 2 voices, play with them. Birth of free mind.

Freedom -> test all shoulds and wants / create your own meaning

Life 3 things you give a shit about -> society (some people around you,  common morality, liked and respected) / money (market) / sex (be fit enough to get it, be biologically fit)

If you have 3 things sorted, do whatever you want to do mahn. You are free to play

- make money
- attract mate from other sex
