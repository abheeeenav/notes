Is Charisma really important?
Do people with power and uncharismatic fail?

Modi? Has Charisma and Power but success or failure?
Hilary Clinton? Uncharismatic and Powerful, a failure again.

Do Leaders need to be Charismatic and powerful?

Why even these leaders are criticized? Power leads to criticism

Who akes a Good CEO? a Builder or a Schmoozer (Conversationalist?)

Magent for criticism sometimes a sign not that someone is the wrong person for a job, but that they're the right one.
