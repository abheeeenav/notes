1) The ability to be mission orientated.
- A leader has a deep eye for meaning, they see an operation and they create the meaning. 
- Start with the why.

2) Build an environment of trust and inspire action.
- Fear is deep coded within us.
- It's not a good way to lead people by inciting fear in them.
- Allow the team members to be vulnerable and open.
- People do like to be lead by a leader.
- Environment of trust brings inspiration for the desired action. 

3) Know how to measure a worthy opponent.
- Don't let your feel good fantasy come in the way.
- Look forward to a worthy opponent and a healthy competition.
- Learn to offer respect.

4) Be okay with going last and be willing to go first.
- Don't get carried away with over expressing yourself.
- Be a good listener.
- Be willing to lead if your team have nothing to say.

5) Vision and Flexibility
- Be adaptive and have a wide vision.
- Set goals to create leverage.
( This will be discussed in depth in the Pro League)

6) Ownership of everything your team does. 
(one of the most important aspect)
- Take the responsibility and inspire others by becoming an example.
- All of us are programmed to be a leader, we share this common consciousness.
- Whether becoming the leader yourself or being lead by one, It's about the wolf you feed.
