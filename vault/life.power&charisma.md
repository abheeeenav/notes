Is Charisma really important?
Do people with power and uncharismatic fail?

Modi? Has Charisma and Power but a success or failure?
Hilary Clinton? Uncharismatic and Powerful, a failure again.

Does Leaders need to be Charismatic and powerful?

Why even these leaders are criticized? Power leads to critisicm

Who akes a Good CEO? a Builder or a Schmoozer (Conversationalists?)

Magent for crticism sometimes a sign not that someone is the wrong person for a job, but that they're the right one.
