Design
- Banner / Emails / SM are static
- Product : App / Website, not static. Continuous spaces. 
- Designing perfectly, important to understand how people use it.
- people spend more time on product
- In product design, follow AARRR framework. Also called Pirate framework.

A : Acquisition 
A : Activation
R : Retention
R : Referrals
R : Revenue 

- App is series of funnels

Acquistion
- Top of funnel
- contains ads campaigns, emails etc.
- as we move down users keep dropping
- Users drop off at each stage of funnel.
- for Acquisition, successful stage would be acquiring of customers

Activation
- activate people

Retention
- people remain on app

Referrals
- users bringing users. 
- Ecom uses revenue funnels.


- PM looks at differnet funnels, how we design funnels and how we analyze them.

Eg. Avalon Meta
- Acquistion : IG ads, post
- Activation : get user to watch atleast 5 mins of lesson (unaxademy), different for every app. Define what you call an activated user.
- Retention : people coming today, next week, push notification.
- Referrals : reward users for reffeering. Cost of acquisition is zero
- Revenue : Purchades


For Ecommerce
- Acquisition: Ad, Google, Video Ad
- Activation : Good Product Descriptions, Good Reviews on product page + UGC, Consideration of buying, purchase decision, Customer Service (Chatbots/Intercoms), Timer Tactic (sense of urgency conversion tactic), Exit Intent popups
- Revenue : 
- Retention
- Referral


For Landing Pages Example.
- Acquisition: vids, creative strategy with copy and creative on yt and insta
- Activation : when user lands on landing page : social proof, timer, photo, videos, lead capture (lead magnet) etc.
- Lead : you spend money to acquire, you can retarget them
- you use leads magnet -> Newsletters -> Engage them. If they drop off your funnel, you can again acquire them in your funnel.
- Social proof by creating FOMO. Tool is fomo.com. 
- Metric : Click through rate, Impressions

- Revenue : Making a decison at this point, Social Proof, xyz has brought this(social proof banner), upsells(related items) , cross sells (related items). Metric you are trying to increase is AOV (Average order value).

- For courses and stuff AAR are important

- For ecom and others we want users to stay. So that they buy more 

- Retention : DAU / WAU / MAU (Metric of Daily, Weekly, Monthly)

- When running FB Ads, CAC is 1$, you want to pull out more than 1$ out of him.
- if this user invites 2 more users, CAC becomes zero. Hencd no cost. Thus referrals works here. Incentivized to invite.
- Dropbox uses loops, also called viral loops. System that feeds itself and brings more people in.
- Craft your referrals creatively and sensibly.



FUNNEL ANALYSIS
How to create successful analysis?

- Look other funnels that work, and get idea.
- TaiLopez tactics and strategies, deconstructing individual pieces and put it them
- your eyes should be always open, build a library in your head. Use in situation keep building examples in your head.

- Art + Science
- not all of it comes down to data, a lot of it is science
- Booking com has a funnel that makes you move forward with numbers, copywriting. They using numbers in creative way. 1. 100 people are looking. 2. All places, this is cheapest. 3. 90% of family recommed this place. Every step is measured and measuring and being creative. Copy matters.

- Intution + Data
- Ideas stored in your head builds your intuition.
- eye for good design : looking everything round you, and breaking down it
- Creativity consists of remixing building blocks.
- Remixing and creating new things
- Figure building blocks, figure how they work and brush your intuition 
- Read steal like an artist


- Two type of analysis : qualitative & Quantitative 

Qualitative tools
How user behaves
- fullstory.com : session recording tool. Watch user journey. Putting yourself in shoes of user.
- appsee.con : journey tools for apps
- uxcam.com : capture user sessions
- inspectlet.com 


Quantitative tools
- Google Analytics : Almost Everything. Basic things to have on any website
- hotjar.com : qualitative + quantitative 
- visualeyes.design (Visual Importance). Naturally your eyes gravitate to things according to hierarchy.
- vwo.com


Full Stack Tools (Marketers use)
- clickfunnels.com
- leadpages.com
- convertri.com


A/B Tests
- Most people have misconception. They think A/B test sounds like you create two options and you get opinions. That not A/B
- A/B test is actually build 2 options and analyze. Users are divided to see all options. And you define metrics and analyze
- for A/B testing you need large audience.
- If audience is small, we cant measure statistical significance. Have enough people to validate. Sample size is huge. 





For Freelancing

A : Inbound / Outbound
A : Prospecting
R : project / more project
R : more clients for refferal
R : more revenue 

Add GA to your portfolio site.
No. Of users
Bounce rate
Time spent

Multivariate analysiss
Iterations



Ideally, due iterations. Dont make first thing and relase. See what works through intuition and iterate and iterate.
Check video on iteration.



Activation : converts users you got into active users. But you need to define who are your active users. Active user can be differnet for different products.

Define your active users.
Activation is a process.

For App
Activation : Internal / External, App notifications. Reason for users to come back. Email notifications


Biggest mistake is not realizing funnel exits. Try to recognize the existence of funnel. Zoom in and break down the funnel.


Reasons of dropoff 
- disinterest
- too difficult 
- confused 
This is called friction. You need to remove friction.

Analyze your funnel, find possible pointsbof friction from and remove them by qualirtaobe and quantitaive



ProTip
- Dont ask un necessary things.


- when building funnels, you wont work with all funnels at same time. You work at particular stage for months then switxh and stuff.
