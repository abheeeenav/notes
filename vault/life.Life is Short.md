Is life really short? 
or we make is by focusing on bs throughout.

Our span is limited, and form limited span, if most of our focus in bs, how we will have time? This makes life is short.

- Reduce BS from your life
- Focus on things that matter
- Build your impatience to do your work right now which you want to.
- Don't delay your stuff
