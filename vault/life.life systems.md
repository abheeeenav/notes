There are two ways to approach life, you can have a system where you want short term results and you can have a system where you have a long term game plan. The latter one is more robust and beneficial.

Why the second one? Power of compounding kicks in. At every step you become curious about everything, learn everything and like a stack, everything piles up which compounds into long-term gains.

Short term approaches aren't as robust and sustainable because your healthy habits need consistency and discipline.

Here your art of experimentation comes into play. Write your experiments, test them out, absorb the results, if they suit you keep them, if they don't discard them, and try something new. 

For example, I today decide to meditate 30 mins in the morning every day consistently for the next 30 days, I will observe this experiment every day and after 30 days will decide to keep it or not. You just needn't do things that other people are doing. Build your own system. If you want to wake up at 2 PM in the morning is also good as waking at 6 AM till it satisfies you and your work according to your system/

This is how you create your life system. Define what you want from your system, plan around it, experiment, and iterate it till your work doesn't look like work and you legit enjoy that system.

People often talk about work/life balance but what if your work is as good as life and are interconnected. What will you do if you don't work? Even small things like writing and reading are work for your brain. So the idea of having a work/life balance doesn't seem to suit much. Rather than create a weaved system where your life and work are interconnected.
